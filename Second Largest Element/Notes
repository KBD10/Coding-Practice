My Approach 

Selection Sorting approach 

1) In first iteration the largest will be in the last index.

2) In the next iteration the if the second largest is not equal to the largest then will return the
largest element of the current iterating list.

3) will continue the iteration on the shortening list until we found the largest element of the current list
which is not equal to the largest of the array.

4) if not found then return -1

Time Complexity - Worst Case is O(n^2)

2nd Approach In one iteration

1) Using 2 variable
